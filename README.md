## cronjob-template
Example of project with a Cronjob.

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress, it's just a proof of concept for now.
Anything could potentially change in the future.

The cronjob files will be in the `cronjob` directory:
- Create the IAM role with the correct permission/policy
- Update the `deploy.json` file accordingly
- Create a release to trigger the deployment of this cronjob
